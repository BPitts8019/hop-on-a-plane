## This Week’s Theme

**I Wish I Could Just Hop on a Plane...**

_(Features practicing integrating with real External APIs)_

Your challenge this week is to integrate with a [Countries API](https://rapidapi.com/apilayernet/api/rest-countries-v1) and create a travel planner app. The app should allow users to look up countries and places they want to travel to and using the API, you should return them interesting facts and tidbits about the country.

### Standard Challenge:

-  Sign up for an API KEY with https://rapidapi.com/apilayernet/api/rest-countries-v1
-  Create an application that takes in user inputs and queries the Countries API for information on that user’s input country.
-  Store each location queried along with some fun facts

### Bonus Challenge:

-  Plot all the locations a user queries on a map
-  Come up with an algorithm that creates a travel itinerary connecting all locations. See if you can make it the shortest path possible!
